1. Introduction and Discription

  1.1 Brief Introduction
  My game is inspired by the famous game Sudoku. In my game, there is a gameboard with four rows and four columns, constructing a 4*4 square and totally 16 numbers. In this project, I designed   a cpp code to complete the game. A gameboard with numbers and blanks will be generated for players to fill in numbers 1 to 4.  After solving the gameboard, players should make sure that each   raw, column and each 2*2 block at the corner are exactly filled with numbers from 1 to 4, otherwise they are not able to win the game. I also wrote a Sudoku with 9*9 gameboard but it seems     to take too much time to run. I have included a test version of it.
