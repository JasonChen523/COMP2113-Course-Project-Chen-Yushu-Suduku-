##Description
My game is inspired by the famous game Sudoku. In my project, there is a gameboard with four rows and four columns, constructing a 4*4 square and totally 16.
In this project, I designed a cpp code to complete the game. A gameboard with numbers and blanks will be generated for players to fill in numbers 1 to 4. The players should make sure that each raw, column and each 2*2 small square at the conrner are numbers 1 to 4 after completing the gameboard, otherwise they are not able to win the game.
